//As the name implies, type conversion is the process of converting a value from one type to another.
// Values in JavaScript can be of different types. You could have a number, string, object, boolean â€“ you name it. Sometimes, you may want to convert data from one type to another to fit a certain operation.
// Type conversion can either be implicit (automatically done during code execution) or explicit (done by you the developer).

// Implicit Type Conversion is also known (and more commonly referred to) as Coercion while Explicit Type Conversion is also known as Type Casting.
